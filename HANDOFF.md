# Handoff: Vixinman Household Compendium

Context for whoever (whichever Claude) picks this up next. This repo started life as
**Solbiz** — an internal ops tool for **ECC Solar** (NM solar installer): clients, jobs,
licenses/permits/compliance, inventory, payroll, the works. It's being converted into a
**household** version: routine tasks + ongoing projects (repairs, builds, certifications)
for one household, not a multi-client business.

---

## Status: what's already done

The **text/branding rebrand pass is complete and verified.** Confirmed via repo-wide
search (zero remaining matches for `ECC` / `Solbiz`, case-insensitive, across
`.py`/`.html`/`.sql`/`.md`/`.js`/`.txt`, excluding `dist`/`build`/`.git`/screenshots):

- **Product name:** "Solbiz" → **"Compendium"** (short form used in nav/titles/cache
  keys) / **"Vixinman's Home Compendium"** (full display name)
- **Company name:** "ECC Solar" / "ECC" → **"Vixinman Designs"** — copyright notice,
  `LICENSE`, code comments, invoice remit-to block, `schema.sql` comments, all templates
- **Desktop packaging paths:**
  - `~/Solbiz` → `~/Compendium` (data dir)
  - `Solbiz.exe` → `Compendium.exe`
  - `Solbiz-Import` → `Compendium-Import`
  - `solbiz-error.log` / `solbiz-startup-error.log` → `compendium-error.log` /
    `compendium-startup-error.log`
  - `desktop/run_solbiz.py` → `desktop/run_compendium.py`
  - Env var `SOLBIZ_DATA_DIR` → `COMPENDIUM_DATA_DIR` (verified consistent between
    `desktop/run_compendium.py` and `app.py`'s `DATA_DIR = Path(os.environ.get(...))`)

**NOT done yet:**
- **Visual theme.** `templates/base.html` still uses the original green
  (`--brand: #1a6e3c`, `--brand-dark: #12522c`). The target aesthetic is
  **parchment / illuminated-manuscript**: natural paper-fiber background, ornate
  borders, accent colors in blue, green, red, gold/brass, and black ("burnt wood"). This
  is real visual design work (textures, border art, probably a different typeface), not
  a CSS-variable swap — treat as its own phase, explicitly deferred by the user until
  after the schema/feature reorg below is done.
- **The structural/domain reorg** — this is the actual task for this session. See below.

## The task: reorg from solar-business shape to household shape

The user chose **Option A**: collapse the `clients` entity entirely (no more
multi-customer model — this manages one household), and **repoint the existing
`employees` infrastructure to represent household members** rather than building
something new from scratch.

### Core entity changes

| Old | New | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `clients` table | **removed** | No separate customer entity. Projects/tasks belong to the household directly — drop the FK, not just the label. |
| `jobs` table + pipeline | **`projects`** | Keep the shape (versioning, per-job BPMN chart, standardized pipeline with gated stages). Drop `client_id` FK. Rename pipeline stages: `Proposal → Job Prep → Installation → Inspections → Closing → Complete` (+ `Lost`) becomes `Planning → Prep → In Progress → Wrap-up → Done` (+ `Abandoned`) — permit sign-off / inspections / certification exams are steps within Wrap-up, not their own stage (resolved, see Open Questions). |
| `employees` table + org chart | **`household_members`** | Same table shape (name/nickname dup-guard, licenses & certs per person, per-person dashboard) survives. The 28-role org-chart (`reports_to` hierarchy, Sales/Design/Warehouse/Install departments) shrinks to a small role set — see below. |
| Task generation (single stream, job-driven) | **split into `routine_tasks` vs `project_tasks`** | User explicitly wants routine (recurring chores) separate from tasks that are steps within a specific project. Project tasks keep today's job-generated/auto-assigned-by-role behavior, just renamed. Routine tasks are a new, lighter table — recurrence rule, assigned household member, no pipeline stage. |

### Roles — from 28 solar org-chart roles down to:
- Adult / Parent
- Kid / Dependent
- **External helper** — a contractor, tutor, or coach who touches a project but isn't a
  household member. **Resolved: real table** (structured contact info, reusable across
  projects), not a free-text field — see Open Questions.

**Cut as a consequence of the smaller role set**: the new-member onboarding checklist
workflow, payroll pay-type multipliers/overtime rules, and the GM/Admin tiered
permission-grant system with expiration dates. **Resolved (see Open Questions):**
household-level access control survives in a lightweight form — a simple `is_admin`
flag on `household_members` (Parent/Adult = full access by default) plus the ability to
individually grant a specific permission to one non-admin member case-by-case. No
expiration dates, no multi-tier hierarchy beyond that.

### Requirements Engine (was Rules Editor / L/P/C Directory)
**Keeps its shape almost exactly** — this is one of the strongest carryovers. The
"pick a type → the app surfaces what's required" pattern generalizes cleanly from
*permits/licenses/compliance* to *permits/certifications/prerequisites* (e.g., pick
"add a deck" → surfaces building-permit requirement; pick "get EMT certified" →
surfaces prerequisite coursework). Verbatim source-text field, verify/unverified
callouts, and the consolidation-of-shared-requirements behavior all still make sense.

### Inventory / BOM asset registry
**Keeps its shape minus barcode scanning** — on-hand/needed/ordered status, stock
ledger, stale-stock notice all carry over. **Resolved (see Open Questions): barcode
generate/print/scan is cut** — built for a multi-person crew truck-loading parts, doesn't
fit household scale. Swap the 439-item solar catalog (`inventory_seed.py`) for an
**empty household catalog** (resolved: ship empty, no starter set — items get added as
actually needed).

### Cut entirely — no household equivalent
- Payroll, pay types, overtime, pay periods, payroll reminder
- NM statewide reference data — 33 counties' AHJ contacts, utility interconnection
  contacts (`nm_directory.py`). **Resolved (see Open Questions): repurpose** its shape
  as a generic **contractor/vendor directory** (plumber, electrician, warranty phone
  numbers) rather than dropping it.
- Customer-facing invoice generation (50/40/10 progress billing), QuickBooks export, NM
  gross-receipts-tax line
- Work Bag field-crew mode — built for a multi-person install crew in the field. Unless
  the user wants to keep a stripped-down "on-site task" mode for whoever's doing
  yardwork/repairs that day.

### Keeps as-is — already domain-agnostic
AI Assistant (Claude/Gemini chat over the data), in-app Help, audit log, Boards
(standalone to-dos not tied to a project), notifications inbox.

### Billing → Project budget tracking
Keep the ledger *shape* (income/expense entries, dollar/date/category/party/reference,
receipt attach) but repoint it from **customer billing** to **project budget
tracking** — budget vs. actual spend per project. Drop customer invoicing, QuickBooks
export, and the NM tax logic that goes with it (see "cut entirely" above).

## Open questions — resolved 2026-08-15

1. **Verify stage:** ~~own pipeline stage, or folded into Prep/Wrap-up?~~ **Folded into
   Wrap-up.** Pipeline becomes `Planning → Prep → In Progress → Wrap-up → Done` (+
   `Abandoned`) — permit sign-off/inspections/cert exams are steps within Wrap-up, not
   their own stage.
2. **External helpers** (contractor, tutor, coach touching a project): ~~real table, or
   just a free-text field?~~ **Real table.** Structured contact info, reusable across
   multiple projects — not just a free-text field.
3. **Household-level access control:** ~~worth keeping any permission tiers, or drop all
   of it?~~ **Keep a lightweight version:** a simple `is_admin`-style flag on
   `household_members` (Parent/Adult = full access by default), *plus* the ability to
   individually grant a specific permission to a single non-admin member on a case-by-case
   basis (e.g. letting one kid edit the budget without making them a full admin). Explicitly
   **not** the old GM/Admin tiered system with expiring grants — no expiration dates, no
   multi-tier hierarchy beyond admin/non-admin + individual overrides.
4. **Vendor/contractor directory:** ~~repurpose `nm_directory.py`'s shape, or cut
   outright?~~ **Repurpose.** Reuse its shape for a household vendor/contractor directory
   (plumber, electrician, warranty numbers) instead of building new.
5. **Barcode/asset scanning:** ~~worth keeping, or overkill?~~ **Cut.** Built for a
   multi-person install crew truck-loading parts — doesn't fit household scale. Plain
   on-hand/needed/ordered inventory tracking survives without it.
6. **Inventory starter catalog:** ~~ship empty, or seed a starter set?~~ **Ship empty.**
   No pre-seeded household catalog — items get added as actually needed.

## Practical notes for implementation

- The rebranded file set (this repo's current state) was packaged and handed to the user
  as a zip to unzip over their local clone and push — confirm that landed correctly as a
  first step before making further changes.
- `app.py` is ~11k lines, monolithic (no ORM, raw SQL, Flask + Jinja). Expect
  `client_id` and `employees`/role references scattered widely — this is a search-first,
  not memory-first, task.
- `schema.sql` is the source of truth for the data model; work from there outward when
  planning the `clients`-removal and `employees` → `household_members` migration, since
  foreign keys will cascade into more places than the obvious ones (job versioning/audit
  log, BPMN export, the AI Assistant's read-only query tools in `ai_assistant.py`, etc.).
- Visual/parchment theme work is explicitly out of scope for this pass — don't touch
  `templates/base.html` CSS vars beyond what's needed to keep things functional.
